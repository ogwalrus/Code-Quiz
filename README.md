# Code-Quiz
## Overview
This website is a code quiz where users can test their knowledge of coding concepts. Users can start the quiz by clicking the "Start" button, which will initiate a timer and present them with a question. Each time a question is answered, another question will be presented. If a user answers a question incorrectly, time will be subtracted from the clock. The game will end either when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0.

At the end of the game, users will be given the option to save their initials and score.
